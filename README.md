# pixel4impact

A platform to make donations for NGOs more appealing by allowing all donors to create a collaborative unique piece of art.

## What is this project about?

Pixe4Impact is a new way to make donations to NGOs. Instead of just giving some cryptocurrencies, donors will need to select a pixel and a color from a pre-defined canvas and this information is stored forever in the blockchain attached to the donation.
At the end of the fund-raising campaign, a unique collaboratively image is created by all the donors of that campaign.

## How does it work?

A NGO can create a campaing in the Pixel4Impact platform. This process will deploy a new smart contract specific for this fund-raising campaing with the repective information about the canvas size.

Afterwards, NGOs will have a unique address/url for their campaign where donors will access to make their donations. Donors at that time select the pixel they want from the canvas as well as the color of their preference and the amount they are willing to donate. This information will then be stored in the smart contract allowing Pixel4Impact to render the respective image.

In order to make the donations and create the campaigns, we are using uPort which allows to create more transparency for fund-raising campaigns as donations are tight to an identity.

## What's next?

Please check the live projec at [pixel4impact.org](https://pixel4impact.org) where anyone can create a campaign and participate in the donations.

We plan to extend this project with the aim of making donations and usage of donations more transparent in order to avoid bad usage of the funds collected.

Currently I am developing this project alone so if this makes sense for you feel free to contact me, even if you are not on the development side! :)

I am also contacting several NGOs and partners in order to create some partnerships that allow us to prove this concept and create impact with just a pixel!
